# DiffMAE - Unofficial PyTorch Implementation

This repository contains an **unofficial** PyTorch implementation of DiffMAE (Diffusion Masked Autoencoder)
For more details, please refer to the original paper: [DiffMAE: Diffusion Masked Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03283).

This code is based on [https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae](https://github.com/facebookresearch/mae).

I have currently uploaded only the pre-training stage code and will update the code related to the fine-tuning stage soon.
